### Decimal to binary

Write a method that receives a positive integer value and returns its base-2
representation as a string.  

_More info: [Binary number (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number#Conversion_to_and_from_other_numeral_systems)_

_Examples:_
```
decimalToBinary(3)   =>  "11"
decimalToBinary(10)  =>  "1010"
decimalToBinary(127) =>  "1111111"
```

**Note**: you should __not__ use any predefined method for this (like
          `Integer.toBinaryString`) but try write your own manual algorithm
          for doing this conversion.
