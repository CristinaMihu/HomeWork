### Words Count

Write a method __wordCount(text)__ which receives a text as an input parameter
(a String value), splits it into separate words, then counts and returns
the number of words. Words are considered to be separated only by spaces
(one or more!)

_Example:_
```
    wordCount("Aa bb cc dd") => 4
    wordCount("   xyz  ")    => 1
    wordCount("  ")          => 0
```
___Hint__: you may use the `split()` method present on String to separate
           the words - search online info about using it (some other useful
            String methods to check: `trim`, `isEmpty`)._
