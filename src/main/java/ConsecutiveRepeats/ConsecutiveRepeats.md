### Consecutive repeats

Write a method that takes an array of numbers and returns just the numbers
that are repeating on consecutive positions in the array, as a single
String value (containing the numbers separated by space).

_Example:_
```
[1, 4, 3, 4]  => ""
[1, 4, 4, 4, 3, 5, 5, 4, 4]  => "4 5 4"
[1, 4, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8, 7, 2, 2, 9, 9]  => "4 2 9"
[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]  => "1 1" (ok to repeat value 1, there are 2 different sequences)
```
